# AAStar Community

- To continuously build the Ethereum Account ecosystem following the roadmap of Ethereum, we created the AAStar community.
- Here, we will research and discuss the current contract wallets centered around Account Abstraction(ERC4337, RIP7650, and more), the technology and products of Smart Contract Wallets, as well as the related ecological construction.
- In the future, we will also expand discussions on topics related to multi-chain account deployment, Decentralized Identity (DID), decentralized record-keeping and credit, Non-Fungible Tokens (NFT), and SBT, among other related subjects.

## Why we build AAstar
- The blockchain market value reached $3 trillion before falling to $1 trillion, and has since recovered to $1.5 trillion, now it is rising again.
- It is a rising and huge market, most on-chain assets are protected by encryption technology, commonly known as blockchain accounts.
- Ensuring the security of blockchain accounts is paramount.
- And if Ethereum service for the Human Digital future, we must have a flexible, easy-to-use, low-cost, and secure crypto account system to service the billions of users.
- So Account Abstraction is a way to solve this mass adoption problem, let's try to build a future account system!
